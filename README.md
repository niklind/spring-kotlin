# A reactive Spring 5 / Spring Boot 2 app written in Kotlin

This is an example application to demonstrate Spring 5 / Spring Boot 2 using Kotlin. It's based on [spring-kotlin-deepdive](https://github.com/sdeleuze/spring-kotlin-deepdive) by [SÃ©bastien Deleuze](https://github.com/sdeleuze/)

## Where to go from here

If you want to go even further with Kotlin, it can be used for Gradle build via its Kotlin
DSL and for frontend / multiplatform code, see [spring-kotlin-fullstack](https://github.com/sdeleuze/spring-kotlin-fullstack)
example project.
